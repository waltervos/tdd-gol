# Game of Life #
This Game of Life implementation was made as part of the NS TDD coding dojo. Starting up the exercise I focused on inside out style TDD, defining components that can be stitched together as a running app.

I ended up finishing this version on my own, and used tkinter (new to me) to create the visualisation.

To initialise the virtual environment, run:

```poetry install```*

\* Make sure poetry is installed first (`pip install poetry`)

# Running the tests #

To run the tests, execute:

```poetry run pytest-watch```

# Running the simulation #

To run the visualisation, execute:

```poetry run python -m tdd_gol```
